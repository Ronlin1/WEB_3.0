# WEB_3.0 Top Learning Resources


Hey there ðŸ‘‹, I am sure you have come across the term or buzzword ``` Web 3``` that the tech, crypto and venture-capital types have become infatuated with lately.  

### What is ``` Web 3 ``` ?
``` Web 3 ```, also known as ```Web 3.0```, is an idea for a version of the Internet that is decentralized and based on peer-to-peer technologies such as public blockchains.

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1638853291490/XQPW2bLte.png)
There is a collection of web 3 libraries that allow you to interact with a local or remote Ethereum node using ```HTTP```, ```IPC``` or ```WebSocket```.

```Web 3``` libraries help us interface with the blockchain easily, make transactions, and interact with smart contracts. Using a web3 library we can develop decentralized applications (dapps) that reside on the blockchain or interact with it.

In a ```Web 3```  World, people control their own data and bounce around from social media to email to shopping using a single personalized account with much privacyâœŒ.

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1638853267604/BDICMD3Q5.png)
I believe Web3 is about grabbing some of the power back unlike the current web that is dominated by ```FAANG``` companies and many others.

Web 3 is a nascent tech and would probably power the metaverse and many dApps are being built.

To me, the most exciting parts of this space are Decentralization,  [DeFi](https://blog.coinbase.com/a-beginners-guide-to-decentralized-finance-defi-574c68ff43c4),  [Governance](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-basics/governance/)  /  [DAOs](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/what-dao/) , and  [Decentralized Web](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2rXJLW_93o) Infrastructure.

Because of this, I'm focusing on both Ethereum development and Solidity. With the Solidity programming language, you can program smart contracts for Ethereum as well as for many other ```EVM``` Compatible  [Blockchains](https://chainlist.org/).

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1638865314875/Oj4VPjOod.png)
As of this writing, Ethereum also has a powerful and important combination of momentum, developer mindshare, and existing production  [dapps](https://everest.link/).

Ethereum is also currently moving to a new consensus mechanism,  [Proof of Stake.](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/)  

This will somehow address the environmental concerns I addressed in my NFTs [blog](https://blog.octachart.com/nfts-frequently-asked-questions). 

### The Resources ðŸ“‘
There are tons of resources you can learn about Web 3 and I will just bring a few major ones I have found for your disposal and in the end, you gotta choose your poison ðŸ™‚.

#### ðŸ“Œ Ethereum Docs
Why not start with the official documentation of the blockchain that will make this a success?

Scan through the  [Ethereum Docs](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/) . Be sure to check out the section  [Intro To Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/intro-to-ethereum/)  as well as anything else that catches your eye.

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1638854728784/tMo9xbqxc3.png)
Also be sure to check out the dapp showcase to get a good understanding of the successful apps being built and used in the current ecosystem.

#### ðŸ“Œ Solidity Docs
Solidity is a curly-bracket language. It is influenced by C++, Python and JavaScript, and is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). 

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1638854907081/rgzuieIJK.png)
The Solidity docs are a really good place to get started, especially solidity by example. This gives you a few examples of popular smart contracts like voting, an auction, remote purchase, and micropayments.


#### ðŸ“Œ Remix IDE 
It's really easy to play around with and start building smart contracts without having to set up any type of development environment by using the  [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
